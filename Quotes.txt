"Practicing contentment is a radical act in a consumption-driven society"

Cronon

"It is not the things we label as wilderness that are the problem—for nonhuman nature and large tracts of the natural world do deserve protection—but rather what we ourselves mean when we use the label."

Cronon

"One could almost measure wilderness by the extent to which our recognition of its otherness requires a conscious, willed act on our part."

Cronon

The sublime in regards to nature was an emotion "remarkably close to terror," but became "domesticated" in the later half of the nineteenth century, leading to a more "sentimental" view of nature.

Cronon

"The curious result was that frontier nostalgia became an important vehicle for expressing a peculiarly bourgeois form of antimodernism. The very men who most benefited from urban-industrial capitalism were among those who believed they must escape its debilitating effects."

Cronon

“Only people whose relation to the land was already alienated could hold up wilderness as a model for human life in nature, for the romantic ideology of wilderness leaves precisely nowhere for human beings actually to make their living from the land.”

Kimmerer

"Even our definitions of sustainability revolve around trying to find the formula to ensure that we can keep taking, far into the future"

Krakauer

“His jubilance, however, was short lived”

Kimmerer

"Paying attention to suffering sharpens our ability to respond. To be responsible."

Kimmerer

"Reserving personhood for a single species, in language and in ways of living, perpetuates the fallacy of human exceptionalism, that we are fundamentally different and somehow better, more deserving of the wealth and services of the Earth than other species."

Kimmerer

“for the Earth to stay in balance, for the gifts to continue to flow, we must give back in equal measure for what we are given [...] receiving a gift incurs a responsibility to give a gift in return”.

Kimmerer

"The next step in our cultural evolution, if we are to persist as a species on this beautiful planet, is to expand our protocols for gratitude to the living Earth."

Kimmerer

"Giving thanks implies implies recognition not only of the gift but of the giver".

Rukeyser

"I have gained mastery over my heart.
I have gained mastery over my two hands.
I have gained mastery over the waters.
I have gained mastery over the river."

Nixon

"we are as gods and we must get good at it."

Nixon

“Was this because he was an African? Was it because his writings revealed no special debt to Thoreau, to the wilderness tradition, or to Jeffersonian agrarianism? … he named 17 writers and critics whose work was central to the environmental-studies boom. Something struck me as odd about the list: All 17 were American.”

Nixon

"Climate change, the thawing cryosphere, toxic drift, deforestation, the radioactive aftermaths of wars, oil spills, acidifying oceans, and a host of other slowly unfolding environmental crises confront us with formidable representational obstacles that hinder efforts to mobilize for change."

Nixon

"Anthropocene" he says, "But it’s another thing altogether to fixate on human agency to a degree that downplays the imperfectly understood, infinitely elaborate webs of non-human agency, from the microbiome to the movement of tectonic plates, that continue to shape Earth’s life systems"

Morton

"So hyperobjects are funny. On the one hand, we have all this incredible data about them. On the other hand, we can’t experience them directly. We’ve stumbled upon these huge things, so we need philosophy and art to help guide us, while the way we think about things gets upgraded."

Nixon

"Wilderness or wildland is an intact or undisturbed natural environment. It is a wild natural area that has not been significantly modified by any human activity"

Nixon

"To be sure, humans - especially the wealthiest of us - possess planet-altering powers"

Nixon

"Our temporal bias toward spectacular violence exacerbates the vulnerability of ecosystems treated as disposable by capitalism, while simultaneously intensifying the vulnerability of those whom the human-rights activist Kevin Bales has called “disposable people.”"

Morton

“If you can understand global warming, you have to do something about it. Forget about needing proof or needing to convince more people. [...] Can you understand hyperobjects? Then you are obliged to care about them.”

Nixon

“It’s another thing altogether to fixate on human agency to a degree that downplays the imperfectly understood, infinitely elaborate webs of non-human agency, from the microbiome to the movement of tectonic plates, that continue to shape Earth’s life systems.”

Leopold

"Obligations have no meaning without conscience, and the problem we face is the extension of the social conscience from people to land."

Nixon

"We have decisively altered the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle and the rate of extinction."

Horn

“Land rights and titles remain a sensitive and contested issue”

Mieville

“...some commentators first suggested a connection between the appearance of the icebergs and the growth of coral across the facades of Brussels. It had been three years since the brain coral, pillar coral, and prongs of staghorn coral had first started to appear.”

Morton

Hyperobjects - we "can’t see it. we can’t touch it. But we know it exists, and we know I’m part of it. we should care about it."

Crews

"But aren't we humans also mosquitoes on the skin of a many-headed beast, living between its green hairs, feeding on what grows there?"

Swan

‘I didn’t prove it, scientifically,’ he said, ‘but I could feel it. Of course they suffer. Their long antennae caressing each other – their feet and tongues touching. Yes, they do. They suffer.’

Oliver

“... Out of pain,/ and pain, and more pain/ we feed this feverish plot, we are nourished/ by the mystery.”

Dunham

“my hearts bell / flares gold, valved muscle / an open chamber, yes, / -thirst chokes the throat - / lie with me here, ringed in / distant pickets of tree. My love,”

Crews

"I need to feel the pull of a current stronger than my own thoughts. And so the river blinds me for an instant, every ray of reflected light slipping inside my eyes."

Dunham

“Boats spray forth arcs of salted water, suspended by the camera’s shutter. Before evening this image- viral elegy- will echo across screen and page.”

Montgomery

"Coauthor Roland Anderson reports that octopuses even learned to open the childproof caps on Extra Strength Tylenol pill bottles — a feat that eludes many humans with university degrees."

Swan

"‘“Anthropomorphism” is the word used to describe the belief that animals are essentially like humans, and it is usually applied as a term of reproach, both intellectual and moral.’ Anthropomorphising has been seen as bad, sloppy thinking, an assumption the Daston and Mitman seek to overturn."

Montgomery

"Using his funnel, the siphon near the side of the head used to jet through the sea, Truman would shoot a soaking stream of salt water at this young woman whenever he got a chance."

Crew

“They all paused in mid-chew, strands of grass and leaves hanging from their mouths as they watched to see what I held was more than just a fallen branch. Rifle was not a word they needed to know: they recognized that shape, recalled the shattering report of every shot that had torn through the skin of silence”

Swan

"honeybees and other pollinators are responsible for pollinating at least one-third of all the food we eat”

Montgomery

"we think of our world as the 'real' one, but Athena's is realer still: after all, most of the world is ocean, and most animals live there"

Oliver

"I opened his body and separated the flesh from the bones and ate him. Now the sea is in me: I am the fish, the fish glitters in me; we are risen, tangled together, certain to fall back to the sea,"

Crew

“The only sound is the crush of the surf beckoning me over and over with the voice and rhythm of my own heartbeat, salt calling to salt in the blood that washes through us all.”

Oliver

“I opened his body and separated the flesh from the bones and ate him. Now the sea is in me: I am the fish, the fish glitters in me; we are risen, tangled together, certain to fall back to the sea.”

Dunham

“These scales cannot be balanced. And always more cresting the waves, merciful as death.”
